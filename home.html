          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            The perception of a good UI has revolutionized in the past decade, 
            and some design ideas in the past are no longer favored by younger users today. 
            The "file-sharing based shadow library website" <a href="https://libgen.lc/">Library Genesis </a>, 
            though very useful for many students and scholars in getting access to free digital books and articles, 
            has a UI that could use some improvements to enhance user experience. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder">
          Here's the UI for Libgen:</p>

          <br>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            According to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>,
            Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use.
             The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">There are 5 core quality components to usability:</p><br>

        <div class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center" style="background-color: rgba(251, 144, 5, 0.924);">
          <br>
          <h2 class="text-adjust" style="font-weight: inherit;">Learnability</h2>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            The current UI is relatively easy to learn for a specific group of users. 
            The frequent users of the website are generally students, scholars, 
            or book lovers who want to get access to free public recourses and increase their knowledge. 
            The search box is in the center and is very attention catching for the users. 
            So the first thing a user in this category would do is to enter book names s/he has in mind, 
            if s/he comes with  purpose of finding a very specific book. If the user doesn't have a book or article in mind, 
            it is rather unlikely that the user would visit this website, 
            since it is not easy to browse book options and new release on this website compared to sites such as Goodreads and Amazon. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            Another type of users would be those who actively and frequently upload resources to the website. To this group of users, it would be more difficult
            to learn to upload the documents they have to the site. One of the major reasons is that the front page has too much information, so 
            that it creates unnecessary noise or distraction. The singular gray color palette also doesn't help users locate uploading options and what each button means. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            For users who doesn't read very often or are paperback lovers, 
            the website would be rather confusing, as there's no clear instruction on what each button's function is, 
            what the users should input to the search box, or how the users can get access to the source of the books or articles. 
            The lack of information on the front page would cause this confusion. 
            But after navigating the website for multiple times, 
            the users should be able to use it rather effortlessly.
          </p>

        <br>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center" style="background-color: rgba(251, 214, 5, 0.924);">
          <br>
          <h2 class="text-adjust" style="font-weight: inherit;">Efficiency</h2>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            The website should be pretty efficient for users who have a clear goal of finding a book, 
            but less so for those who want to explore the website and see what they have to offer, 
            since there are too many information listed without a clear structure as mentioned in the learnability section.
          </p>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            The website is pretty inefficient for those who upload books, articles, etc., 
            as there are many options, less hierarchy between options, making it hard to locate things sometimes. 
          </p>
          <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center" style="background-color: rgba(61, 173, 95, 0.924);">
          <br>
          <h2 class="text-adjust" style="font-weight: inherit;">Memorability</h2>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            The front page is pretty memorable, since old users of the Libgen website are 
            rather unlikely to forget the steps to get access to their desired books or articles. 
            However, old users are unlikely to explore other parts of the front page, since the webpage is 
            rather disorganized and it is hard to tell the hierarchy between different links and dropdowns. 
            The lack of recommendations or new offerings on the front page would also decrease old users interest to visit 
            the website just for updates or browsing some recommendations for interesting books.
          </p>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            The other type of users, the users who would upload the media files they acquired to 
            the website, are more familiar with different buttons, dropdowns, and where each link leads 
            to. It wouldn't be hard for them to pick up where everything is for them to upload information after a break from using the website for a while. 
            Yet the website is not ideal for them to navigate, especially with multiple options under each dropdown, 
            and there isn't much color contrast between different buttons to help with memorization.

          <h2 class="text-adjust" style="font-weight: inherit;">Satisfaction</h2>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            The user satisfaction of the website should be moderate, 
            given that the user is happy about finding the materials s/he needs or uploading new content for public browsing.
            However, satisfaction rate might decrease due to convolusion in operating the front page and the general searching experience.
            The font of the website is also very small for readers so that when doing searches, the users need to look closely to the screen to filter the information they need.

          <br>
          <h2 class="text-adjust" style="font-weight: inherit;">Few Errors</h2>
          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            In general, the website doesn't have too many errors, but sometimes the links can lead users to very confusing pages, and the labeling of many buttons are not really understandable.
            However, the amount of errors or indistinguishable text through clicking some link would leave users confused and the user experience isn't optimal.

        <h2 class="text-adjust" style="font-weight: inherit;">Commentary</h2>
        <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
          A very direct observation from evaluating the accessibility of the Libgen website is that many tags 
          are widely exposed directly in the center of the front page, making the front page very noisy and unstructured. 
          There are also two lists that are separated into top navbar and bottom navbar, which is not really efficient 
          for users. There's a table with much unsorted data in the middle, which is not usually helpful for users when they actually use the website, so this part 
          might needs some improvements as well.

            <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger; font-weight: inherit">
              The process from Low-fidelity wireframing to High-fidelity prototyping is a process of evaluating what's aesthetic, what's not; 
              It's a process of adding more possibility of interaction to see which elements in a low-fi wireframe is unreasonable.
              In this process, I decided upon a rather harmonious while not boring color palette to show consistency but also contrast when necessary.
              I categorized elements so they belong to different groups to create a visual hierarchy. I used rather consistent fonts to add to the hierarchy.
              Ultimately, I used this layout to emphasize important information to increase efficiency. There are changes from the low-fi to high-fi structure,
              as I thought the latter more aesthetic and creates more spatial dynamics.

          <p class="text-adjust" style="font-size: larger;">
            Hope you enjoy using the redesigned Libgen website! In the final responsive redesign, I decided to make the break points for navbar 
            smaller so that tablets could also have a holistic view of all the navbar items. I make this decision based on the fact that many tablets
            serve the same function as laptops for many people today. Since the functionality are similar, the design of the navbar should resemble one another.
            In addition, to increase consistency for all the cards, I added "Read More" option to the "Alternative Domains" card. The design of the dropdowns are more modern 
            and that in the prototype. Using the developer tools, the screen could be seen adjusted to fit different device sizes, though for 4K, the content would gather towards the upper part of the screen,
            as the website is designed to be a one-pager.
